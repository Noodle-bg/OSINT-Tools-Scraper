# Scrapers

Here are a bunch of scrapers i tried building for a osint hackathon.
I mostly tried to scrape websites that either dont provide api calls or are paid,
I am myself pretty new to this and wouldnt reccomend anyone to assume what I did is the best way to achieve it.
Lets go through Each one and give a brief summary

## Face Searcher Scraper

Takes in an image as an input and searches it through the internet to fetch the name of the person.
### Note:
I have left an example image in there to help you try the code out for yourself.

## Insta Lookup

Looks up through instagram and resources the account with the photo.
Can trace:
Name to profile
Username to profile

## Pawned

Obviously scrapes from HIBP.

## WhatsMyName

Scrapes Usernames accross a lot of platoforms.
Doesnt work just yet...


Note: For this and any of the above websites, this is the description of what the website does and i just built a scraper to get me the information.
