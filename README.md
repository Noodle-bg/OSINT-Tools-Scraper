# Scrapers

This repository contains a collection of scrapers developed for an OSINT hackathon. These scrapers are aimed at retrieving data from websites that either lack API access or require payment. As a disclaimer, I'm relatively new to this field, so I wouldn't recommend assuming that my approach is the best way to achieve these tasks. Let's take a brief look at each scraper:

## Face Searcher Scraper

This scraper takes an image as input and searches it through the internet to fetch the name of the person.

### Note:
An example image is provided within the repository to facilitate trying out the code.

## Insta Lookup

This scraper explores Instagram to gather information related to a given account's photo. It can trace:

- Name to profile
- Username to profile

## Pawned

This scraper extracts data from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP).

## WhatsMyName

This scraper is designed to collect usernames across various platforms. Please note that it's not fully functional at the moment.

**Note:** The descriptions provided here are for the respective websites, and the scrapers are developed to extract the information mentioned.
